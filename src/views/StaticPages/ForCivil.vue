        <h1>Open Data, Open Access, Open Government</h1>
        <p>In market economy competition, equal access and transparent procurement procedures result in lower prices and higher quality and provide better quality public services. With high pressure on governments to efficiently use taxpayers’ money for delivering public services reducing the cost of public spending is a key aspect of public procurement. It is also important that procurement officers responsible for purchasing goods, services and works for public sector respect taxpayers’ money and execute their duties in such a way that citizens can trust their professionalism and honesty in spending public funds.</p>
        <p>Civil Society has the power to influence political, economic or public interest decisions, serving to monitor the work of government and public institutions and to take an attitude towards policies that are contrary to the citizen interests or in case of power abuse.</p>
        <p>Every citizen and civil society organization shall be given an unrestricted access to public procurement information. Transparency of public procurement information can be easily and inexpensively achieved by implementing digital public procurement systems that by default use Open Data to provide an open access to public procurement information.</p>
        <p>Building on global best practice, the MTender System is developed to satisfy <a href="https://www.open-contracting.org/" target="_blank">Advanced Open Contracting Data Standards</a> and enables open access to public procurement information to all citizens of Moldova and local Civil Society organizations.</p>
        <p>Thanks to this approach, every citizen is able to use information provided by the MTender System to monitor how government is undertaking public duties and whether principles of fair competition and value for money in public procurement are respected in Moldova.</p>
        <p>Upon its completion, the MTender System will provide the Civil Society with dedicated monitoring portal to provide feedback to Contracting Authorities, discuss specific procurements, assess quality of public contract delivery and submit a review request to enforcement bodies when necessary.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Recognizing the value of electronic procurement for civil society in Moldova, piloting of the MTender System is supported by the following non-governmental organizations:</span></p>
